# COVID-19 multi-agent simulation using Mesa

This is a simplistic multi-agent simulation of how COVID-19 can spread.

`main.py`: For running from the commandline. At the end of the run, a chart will show the simulation results.
`run.py`: Main python module for running the simulation. The simulation settings can be changed here.
`server.py`: Visualization module that uses a web browser for visualizing the simulation. Running this will display the simulation grid and a chart of results that can be stepped through or run continuously.

`model.py`: The simulation model.
`person.py`: Agent model that represents one person.
